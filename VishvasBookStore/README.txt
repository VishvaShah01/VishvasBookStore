System.InvalidOperationException: 'An error was generated for warning 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.InvalidIncludePathError': Unable to find navigation ' CoverType' specified in string based include path ' CoverType'. This exception can be suppressed or logged by passing event ID 'CoreEventId.InvalidIncludePathError' to the 'ConfigureWarnings' method in 'DbContext.OnConfiguring' or 'AddDbContext'.'

The solution is: I put space in ProductController.cs file 
var allObj = _unitOfWork.Product.GetAll(includeProperties: "Category,CoverType"); just remove the space between Category,CoverType.
